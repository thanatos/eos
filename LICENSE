<undecided>

With the exceptions of:

* /libcore_nofp.patch, which is from
  https://github.com/thepowersgang/rust-barebones-kernel/blob/ba761599cfa627b6d3059e3f63c07c5974f2a9e7/libcore_nofp.patch
  and has been only slightly modified. It is released into the public domain
  (the same license I found it under); specifically,
  https://github.com/thepowersgang/rust-barebones-kernel/blob/ba761599cfa627b6d3059e3f63c07c5974f2a9e7/LICENSE
* /src/lib.rs, which is from http://os.phil-opp.com/set-up-rust.html /
  https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os, and is dual-licensed under the MIT and
  Apache 2.0 licenses. (The same license that I found it under.) It has been
  modified slightly. (but the modifications are also released under the same
  dual-license, MIT or Apache 2.0.)
